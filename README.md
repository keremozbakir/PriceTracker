# PriceTracker
This programme helps you to track certain products price and get notified when the products are on sale.
It works on otto.de,HNM.de and Zara.de .
You can store as much as product you wish and know the current prices of all your products (even if they are in different websites)

There are a few things you have to do before running the programme

1-)Set up using your own Mongodb database with your database username and password.
you should create a file named "database_connection.py" and define the imported variables there.


After these settings are done you need to go to target website  and copy a link of a product .Here is an example link you can use: https://www.otto.de/p/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-xbox-one-904656898/#variationId=904656899
paste this link when it is asked.The target price is the price you want to get notified.It is pretty straight forward actually.
