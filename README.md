# PriceTracker
This programme helps you to track certain products price and get notified when the products are on sale.
It works on otto.de,HNM.de and Zara.de .
You can store as much as product you wish and know the current prices of all your products (even if they are in different websites)

There are a few things you have to do before running the programme

1-)Set up using your own Mongodb database with your database username and password.


After these settings are done you need to go to target website  and copy a link of a product .Here is an example link you can use: https://www.otto.de/p/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-xbox-one-904656898/#variationId=904656899
paste this link when it is asked.Then you will be asked a product name.Product name is the name you want to save the product in to mongodb database.it can be anything
The target price is the price you want to get notified .For example the product is 90 Euros and when it is 70 Euros you want to be notified.Just write 70 to the target price.It is pretty straight forward actually.
